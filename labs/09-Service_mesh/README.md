# Service mesh

The term service mesh is used to describe the network of microservices that make up such applications and the interactions between them.

On top of Kubernetes, we will use Istio to get behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole.

Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole, offering a complete solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications.

Istio helps developers and operators to address the challenges faced  when  translating a monolithic application in a distributed microservice architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Having a working Minikube environment with kubectl CLI tool pointing to it
- Infrastructure components ([06 - Install infrastructure components on K8S](labs/06-Install_infrastructure_components_on_K8S/README.md)) must be running on Minikube before starting this lab
- Having a bash environment (Linux, Git bash, etc)

## Setup Istio

Download Istio

```console
$ curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

Downloading istio-1.8.1 from https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/download/1.8.1/istio-1.8.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz ...

Istio 1.8.1 Download Complete!

Istio has been successfully downloaded into the istio-1.8.1 folder on your system.

Next Steps:
See https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/ to add Istio to your Kubernetes cluster.

To configure the istioctl client tool for your workstation,
add the /home/developer/ITS-ICT_Microservices/istio-1.8.1/bin directory to your environment path variable with:
         export PATH="$PATH:/home/developer/ITS-ICT_Microservices/labs/09-Service_mesh/istio-1.8.1"

Begin the Istio pre-installation check by running:
         istioctl x precheck 

Need more information? Visit https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/ 
```

Now enter in the Istio folder

```console
$ cd istio-*
```

Prepend the current working dir to the PATH env. variable

```console
$ export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
$ cd ..
```

Install Istio


```console
$ istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
✔ Istio core installed
✔ Istiod installed
✔ Egress gateways installed                                                                   
✔ Ingress gateways installed
✔ Installation complete  
```

## Use Istio with your microservices

Add a namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application later:   

```console
$ kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
namespace/default labeled
```

Now deploy microservices

```console
$ kubectl apply -f ../07-Deploy_microservices_on_K8S/
deployment.apps/customer-deployment created
service/customer-service created
configmap/customer-conf created
deployment.apps/notification-deployment created
configmap/notification-conf created
deployment.apps/order-deployment created
service/order-service created
configmap/order-conf created
```

The application will start. As each pod becomes ready, the Istio sidecar will be deployed along with it.


```console
$ kubectl get svc,pod

```

Notice that each microservices has now two containers in it (READY 2/2).

If there are still pods with a single container (for example the infrastructure Pods), restart them all:

```console
$ kubectl delete pod -n default --all
pod "customer-deployment-5fc97c5659-xlf9d" deleted
pod "customer-mongodb-677d89fddf-scpqp" deleted
pod "kafka-0" deleted
pod "kafka-zookeeper-0" deleted
pod "notification-deployment-5d898f54c5-tvdr2" deleted
pod "order-deployment-796647466b-4cw5b" deleted
pod "order-postgres-0" deleted
```

Now each Pod should have 2 containers in it

```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

kafka-zookeeper-0                          2/2     Running   0          79s

order-postgres-0                           2/2     Running   0          19s
```

Test the customer microservice

```console
$ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=customer -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -c customer-ms -- wget -qO- localhost:8102/customers-service/v2/customers
[]
```

Test the order microservice

```console
$ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=order -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -c order-ms -- wget -qO- localhost:8103/orders-service/v2/orders
[]
```

Apply the Istio resources

```console
$ kubectl apply -f microservices-istio.yaml 
gateway.networking.istio.io/microservices-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/microservices created
```

Ensure that there are no issues with the configuration:

```console
$ istioctl analyze
Info [IST0118] (Service kafka-zookeeper-headless.default) Port name follower (port: 2888, targetPort: follower) doesn't follow the naming convention of Istio port.
Info [IST0118] (Service kafka-zookeeper.default) Port name follower (port: 2888, targetPort: follower) doesn't follow the naming convention of Istio port.
```


## Call microservices through Istio


Discover the Istio NodePort port (in this case 30333)

```console
$ kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}'
30033
```

Discover the Minikube ip (in this case 192.168.39.77)

```console
$ minikube ip
192.168.39.77
```

We are now able to call our microservice through Istio

```console
$ curl -vvv http://192.168.39.77:30033/orders-service/v2/orders
* Expire in 0 ms for 6 (transfer 0x559fba513f90)

```

The empty arrays `[]` mean that the services are available and return no records.

## Install **Kiali**, the Istio UI

```console
$ kubectl apply -f istio-1.8.1/samples/addons/
...
```

If you get some error stating **unable to recognize "istio-1.8.1/samples/addons/kiali.yaml": no matches for kind "MonitoringDashboard" in version "monitoring.kiali.io/v1alpha1"**, you may need to apply the resources using `kubectl` twice.

Wait a few minutes and start a port forward 

```console
$ kubectl port-forward svc/kiali --address 0.0.0.0 -n istio-system 20001:20001
Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:20001 -> 20001
```


Open your browser on http://localhost:20001/kiali

You can see the microservices architecture topology.

What we did until now is needed for the next lab. Please keep all the system running before starting [10 - Microservices monitoring](labs/10-Microservices_monitoring/README.md)
